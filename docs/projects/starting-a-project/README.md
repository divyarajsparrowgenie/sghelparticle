# Starting a project

Follow these steps to set up a new SparrowGenie project from scratch.

## 1) Create the project shell
- Click `New Project` and enter the RFP/RFI name plus due date.
- Set the default timezone and assign a project owner; this drives reminders.

## 2) Import source files
- Upload the requester template (DOCX/XLSX) plus any reference answers.
- If you have prior submissions, import them so AI can reuse phrasing.
- Confirm language and region so terminology and date formats match expectations.

## 3) Clean and segment
- Split large combined documents into sections; keep titles concise.
- Merge duplicate questions and delete empty rows before mapping.
- Tag sections by workstream (Security, Legal, Product, Data) for ownership.

## 4) Assign owners and deadlines
- Use bulk assign for workstreams; set due dates by section.
- Add watchers for reviewers; they get notifications but no ownership.

## 5) Prep for AI fill
- Mark reference sections as `trusted` so AI prefers them when drafting.
- Add glossary items for product names, acronyms, and compliance terms.
- Save standard disclaimers and boilerplate in `Snippets` for quick reuse.

## 6) Kickoff checklist
- Share the timeline and who owns which sections.
- Confirm the approver for each workstream.
- Run a quick search for blocked items (security questionnaires, DPAs, SLAs) and request them early.

## Done?
Move on to `Field mapping` to normalize the template and start drafting.
