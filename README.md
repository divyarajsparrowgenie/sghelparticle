# SparrowGenie Help Center

Welcome! This guide keeps SparrowGenie project teams aligned and fast. Use the sidebar to jump to a workflow, or search for a keyword (hotkey `/`).

## Quick start
1) Open `Starting a project` to create your workspace and import source files.  
2) Follow `Field mapping` to normalize section/question names.  
3) Use AI fill to draft answers, then collaborate and track progress.  
4) Export when every section shows complete.

## How this site is organized
- **Projects** — end-to-end steps from setup to export.
- **Field mapping** — rules and examples for aligning incoming templates.
- **Collaboration** — coming soon; request access from the team if you need it now.

## Search tips
- Press `/` to focus search; press `Esc` to exit.
- Results show the page title plus context so you can skim quickly.
